        <p>
            The floating magnet Sandbox is an interactive simulator with added features of magnets, 
            buoyancy, and drag. I extended upon ammo.js physics engine which is c++ version of bullet physics. 
            I used three.js and webGL for rendering. <br>The main goal of this project was creating an interactive 
            environment. The user can use mouse and keyboard interaction to move and create object, change parameters,
            and change camera perspective and zoom. Physical forces in the simulator such as magnetic forces and 
            drag are calculated using heuristical methods since physically accurate calculations are complicated and 
            hard to generalize to different mesh objects.
        </p>

        <h2 align="left">Approach</h2>
        <p>
            My approach for physics was to add additional external forces to ammo.js physics world. 
            I applied all the forces other than gravity through setVelocity function to the ammo.js 
            physics world, which then checks for collisions and sets correct velocity and rotation upon 
            collision. <br>In three.js programs that use ammo.js for physics engine, all objects exists
            both in the scene space of three.js and physics world of ammo.js. At each time step, three.js 
            objects are updated using the information from the motion state given by the physics world. 
            To implement forces not supported by the ammo.js, I calculated the external forces from the 
            information of the three.js objects and applied acceleration to each of the physics world objects 
            at each time step.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since modeling magnetic field is very challenging, I implemented simple inverse square law for the repulsion and attraction force between magnets.
            Objects can be positively charged, negatively charged, metallic, or none.
            In the image below you can see 4 spheres attached to the magnet bar. Pink and Blue spheres apply magnetic force to the bar while black and white spheres slow down the spinning of the bar.

            <br>
            Buoyancy is calculated based on density, gravity, and ratio of volume under water
            I approximated volume under water using the bounding sphere of the object and sphere cap volume formula below
            For drag I used nasa’s drag equation which approximates the drag using squared velocity and area. 
            I omitted the area term since bounding sphere volume turned out to be too inaccurate for drag.

        <h2 align="left">Implementing External Forces</h2>
        <h3 align="left">General Pipeline</h3>
        <p>
            1. Create objects both in three.js and ammo.js. Add them to the physical world of ammo.js, and rigid bodies array. <br><br>
            2. At each all of render frame, update the magnetic forces. Attraction between opposite charges, 
            repulsion between same chages, attraction of the metallic object is calculated. <br><br>
            3. At the same time, buoyancy and drag is calculated. Buoyancy takes current water level, object 
            density and bounding volume into account. Drag is calculated from current velocity. <br><br>
            4. All of the external forces to each rigid body is applied as acceleration to the objects in the 
            ammo.js physics world. <br><br>
            5. Ammo.js physics world steps forward with updated velocity changing object locations and applying 
            the effect of colisions. <br><br>
            6. Objects in three.js scene is updated according to the information from physics world.<br><br>

        <h3 align="left">Challenges and Solutions</h3>
        <h4 align="left">Dissipating Energy</h4>
        <p>
            Since the ammo.js default world does not support air resistance, and objects floating in my 
            simulation is technically in the air in terms of physical world, they do not stop once force is 
            applied to them. With the implementation of drag, their velocity slows down, but their rotations 
            do not. I used the constraint feature of ammo.js to dissipate energy by turning objects rotation 
            into velocity of its set objects. In the picture below, black and white spheres help slow down 
            the rotation of the magnet bar (yellow)
        </p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <img src="images/object_structure.png" align="middle" width="480px" />
                        <figcaption align="middle">Spheres bind to the bar help dissipate energy</figcaption>

            </table>
        </div>
        <p>
            Linking sphere balls to a magnet bar also allowed me to put opposite charges on the magnet bar. 
            In the picture, blue ball has negative charge and the pink ball has positive charge.
        </p>


        <h2 align="left">Interactivity</h2>
        <h3 align="left">Camera Control</h3>
        <p>
            User can mouse drag on the screen to change perspective. This is implemented with javascript 
            event listeners, spherical coordinates, and three.js camera lookat function which made it easy 
            to point the camera to the center.
        </p>
        <h3 align="left">Selecting Object</h3>
        <p>
            By casting a ray with three.js raycastor, I can obtain the object that the user clicked on. 
            three.js allows the generation of the ray in the camera direction, so I only need to modify 
            starting position and get the first intersection. User can then move the object with arrow keys.
        </p>
        <h3 align="left">Changing Parameters</h3>
        <p>
            User can use keyboard inputs to change different constants like density multiplier, buoyancy constant,
            and drag constant. Current constant is displayed on the top of the screen
